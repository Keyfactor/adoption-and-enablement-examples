# Refactored PowerShell Script: Explanation

## Purpose
This script is designed to process user onboarding data using parallel runspaces. The key functionality includes:
1. Reading user data from a CSV file.
2. Validating input data and environment setup (e.g., checking script file, log folder).
3. Executing the `keyfactor_onboarding.ps1` script in parallel for each CSV row.
4. Logging the output of each processed line.
5. Measuring and providing timing statistics for the entire operation.

## Major Improvements
### 1. Better Code Modularity
- **Functions**: 
  - `CreateLogDirectory`: Handles log directory creation.
  - `ValidateScriptFile`: Validates the script file required for processing.
  - `ProcessCsvLine`: Encapsulates logic to process each row of the CSV.

### 2. Readability
- **Descriptive Variables and Functions**: 
  - `$csvPath` is clearer than `$CSV_PATH`.
  - `CreateLogDirectory` explicitly describes its purpose.
  
### 3. Logging and Monitoring
- **Timestamped Logs**: Outputs of each runspace execution are logged with a unique timestamp.
- **Performance Measurement**:
  - Added a `Stopwatch` to track the total execution time.

## Example Workflow
1. Validate the input environment and script (`keyfactor_onboarding.ps1`).
2. Initialize a runspace pool with a specified number of threads (`maxThreads`).
3. Process each line of the CSV file in parallel:
   - Validate required columns (`name`, `email`, `claim`, `claimType`).
   - Execute the onboarding script in a new runspace.
   - Log the output for each process.
4. Close all runspaces and display execution statistics.

## Key Benefits of Refactoring
- **Maintains Reusability**: Key operations like log creation and script validation are reusable across scripts.
- **Improved Debugging**: Logging skipped CSV lines and timestamped execution helps trace issues.
- **Readable and Maintainable Code**: Modular approach reduces redundancy and increases clarity.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures runtime errors are caught and logged without halting the script.
